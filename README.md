# Java Maze Generator

A small java program that generates a maze with a beginning and end given x and y dimensions and an
optional seed value.

This is to be used in my game, Revenants: The Endless Dungeon to create procedurely-generated levels.
This project will later be translated to C++.

Currently, there are two main issues to address:
  - Exception handling in the driver
  - Null-pointers when generating dead-end paths
