# Java Maze Generator

A small java program that generates a maze with a beginning and end given x and y dimensions and an
optional seed value. The original project is coded in Java, but translated versions in C#/GDScript (GoDot) and C++/Blueprints(Unreal Engine) are also available.

This algorithms will be used in my video game, Revenants.
